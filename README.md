## Description

Full stack chat application built using Golang and MongoDB Atlas in the backend, and React in the frontend. This is an app to further familiarize myself with React. 

 - JWT + Google OAuth2 authentication.
 - The ability to post multiple, personal todos to your dashboard.

Overbloated much? ehh

 ## Installation

   cd api
   go build 
   go mod vender //if you desire to have a folder including the dependencies, otherwise ignore
